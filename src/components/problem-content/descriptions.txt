The Call Center system is designed to manage incoming calls by efficiently assigning them to available agents. When a call arrives, it is dispatched to the agent with the smallest available label. If no agent is available, the system returns â€“1. Additionally, the system provides a method for marking an agent as available once they finish a call.

Design a Bookstore Inventory system that maintains a record of available books. The system should allow adding new books and quantities to the inventory, selling books (which decrements the stock), and retrieving the current inventory state. It needs to handle cases where books may be out of stock, and ensure that the inventory updates correctly with each operation.Design a reservation system for a restaurant that allows customers to reserve tables, cancel reservations, and check table availability. Each table can have at most one reservation at any given time. The system needs to manage different table states efficiently, and handle scenarios like attempting to reserve an already reserved table or canceling a reservation that doesn't exist.
